real time chatting --> when you click on user name in feed you can redirect to inbox and you can chat with other user

user guide --> firstly you need to create two accounts im not adding an validation on gmail, password, username, name due to less time after creating account you can add some post both accounts and when you click on username in feed you directly redirect to the inbox of user there you both can same messages im not make this project so perfect beacuse of my exams im sorry but in one day i can do this level of coding if i have some more days/weeks i can make this so beautifull.

responsibe --> this is not responsibe you have to set screen size for phones iphone XR is perfect choice for this project.

install --> clone this repo. then npm i for downloading the needed files 

tech --> in this project im not using MERN Stack. Beacuse i have limited time and mern is time taking thats why im using in this project ejs, express, mongoDb, Socket.io, passport, tailwindCSS for styling.

NOTE : If you have an problem feel free to ask me. 
Thanks
